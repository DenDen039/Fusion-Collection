bugfixes:
  - fusion_pg - create_pg always broke runtime. Now it executes and creates placement group successfully
    (https://github.com/Pure-Storage-Ansible/Fusion-Collection/pull/53).
deprecated_features:
  - fusion_pg - placement_engine option is deprecated because Fusion API does not longer support this parameter
    It will be removed in the version 2.0.0 (https://github.com/Pure-Storage-Ansible/Fusion-Collection/pull/53).
